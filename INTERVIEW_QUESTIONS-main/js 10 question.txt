1.Explain in brief what is node js?
Node. js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.

 
2.What is V8?
V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. 


 
3.Give an example where call apply bind is. required?
1) Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one. 2) Apply invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array. 3) Bind returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments

let name1={
    firstname:"sumit",
    lastname:"narwal",
}

let printFullName = function(hometown){
    console.log(this.firstname +" "+this.lastname+ " from "+ " "  +hometown);
}

let name2={
    firstname:"Ankit",
    lastname:"Phogat",
    
}
//function borrowing
printFullName.call(name1,"Delhi")

printFullName.apply(name2,["mumbai"])

let printMyName=printFullName.bind(name2,"calcuta")
//console.log(printMyName)
printMyName()


4. What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?

var fs=require("fs")
fs.readFile("file_name","optional-type of file","call_back_function(err,data)")
---------------------------------------
const data=fs.readFileSync("file_name","optional-type of file")
------------------------------------
readFileSync() is synchronous and blocks execution until finished. These return their results as return values. readFile() are asynchronous and return immediately while they function in the background.
